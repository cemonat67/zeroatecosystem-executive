# PROJECT STATUS

## Project
Zero@Production

## Current Stable Status
The project is currently stable on the executive dashboard and documentation side.
The working UI must remain untouched in this documentation-only phase.

## Latest Completed Track
Universal Data Intake Agent — Phase 2 / 2.1

### Completed and already committed
- Agent architecture docs
- Canonical intake schema
- Intake workflow
- Review / approval flow
- Report generator architecture draft
- Intake MVP skeleton
- CSV parser
- Pasted text parser
- Normalized JSON writer
- Flat CSV writer
- Review manifest writer
- Hardening layer
- Source hash
- Record fingerprint
- Validation
- Confidence scoring
- TR/EU numeric coercion fix
- CSV string-preserve fix before normalization

## Stable Checkpoints
- Add Data Intake and Report Generator agent architecture docs
- Add Intake Agent MVP skeleton with CSV and text parsers
- Fix intake numeric coercion for TR and EU number formats
- Fix CSV parsing to preserve raw numeric strings before normalization

## What this means
Zero@Production now has a documented and working foundation for a universal intake layer that can accept heterogeneous source data, preserve raw values safely, normalize records into a canonical structure, and prepare a controlled review flow before downstream use.

## Current Scope Lock
This phase updates documentation only.
No UI, dashboard, modal, or runtime behavior should be changed in this phase.

## Next Phase
Report Generator MVP Skeleton

### Target for next phase
- Build report generator agent skeleton
- Define report input contract from reviewed intake data
- Generate Zero@ standard report payloads
- Support structured report outputs for internal and customer-facing use
- Keep review / approval gate before report generation
- Prepare docs and repo structure for later PDF / DOCX / board-report expansion

## Operational Rule
- Terminal-first
- One safe step at a time
- Backup before patch
- No blind overwrite
- Docs-only commit for this phase

## Repo Documentation Status
The following docs are now the primary source of truth for this stage:
- PROJECT_STATUS.md
- PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
- IMPROVEMENTS.md
- AGENTS.md
- DATA_INTAKE_AND_REPORTING_PLAN.md
- AGENTS_ROADMAP_2026-03-11.md

## 2026-03-14 — SAP Mock Feeder Migration Simulator

A new **SAP-like operational data migration simulator** was implemented to emulate
live ERP → Zero@Production data ingestion.

Module location:

agents/sap_mock_feeder

Capabilities:

• deterministic event generator  
• order + batch continuity  
• realistic factory metrics generation  
• API ingestion simulation  
• CSV export simulation  
• burst migration mode  

Pipeline:

SAP Mock Feeder  
→ Event Generator  
→ API Sender / CSV Writer  
→ /api/intake/raw  
→ intake_agent  
→ normalized JSON  
→ review manifest

Runner features:

mode:
- api
- csv
- both

burst_size:
- configurable event batching

Test results:

✓ API ingestion confirmed  
✓ CSV export confirmed  
✓ hybrid mode confirmed  

Golden snapshot created:

# Project Checkpoint — 2026-03-14

## Zero@Production — Executive Decision Engine

The Zero@Production dashboard is currently operating as a **Factory Decision Support System** for textile dyehouse production planning.

The system integrates operational data and sustainability indicators to help production managers evaluate machine allocation decisions.

### Current Capabilities

The Production Decision Engine currently provides:

- recommended machine selection
- machine capacity verification
- machine load percentage
- estimated water usage
- estimated energy consumption
- estimated CO₂ emissions
- capacity verdict
- decision explanation

### Machine Alternatives

The system automatically presents **three candidate machines**:

- Recommended machine
- Alternative machine A
- Alternative machine B

Each candidate includes:

- load %
- estimated energy
- estimated CO₂
- capacity verdict

### Machine Switch Simulation

Users can click an alternative machine to simulate switching.

The system calculates:

- load delta
- energy delta
- water delta
- CO₂ delta

and generates a sustainability comparison.

### Impact Score

A weighted sustainability score is calculated using:

Impact Score =
0.4 * Energy Δ  
+0.3 * CO₂ Δ  
+0.2 * Water Δ  
+0.1 * Load Δ  

Severity levels:

- LOW
- MODERATE
- HIGH

### What-If Simulation

The dashboard includes a **machine load slider** allowing users to simulate:

- different load scenarios
- recalculated energy
- recalculated water
- recalculated CO₂
- updated impact score

### Next Development Phase

The next phase of development is **Machine Optimizer**.

This layer will introduce:

- automatic machine ranking
- decision score calculation
- best machine recommendation
- scenario comparison
- executive optimization panel

Goal: evolve Zero@Production into a **Machine Optimization Engine for industrial production planning**.

## 2026-03-14 — Brain V2 Executive Drawer Integration Checkpoint

### Completed
- Brain V2 backend endpoint is live:
  - `/api/brain/status/v2?facility=ekoten&strategy=balanced`
- Executive drawer now fetches Brain V2 first and falls back to V1 if needed.
- `assets/js/executive-ai-insights.js` was stabilized after previous broken regex patch risk.
- Executive UI now renders:
  - overall status
  - executive views
  - signals
  - anomalies
  - recommended actions
  - optimization decision
- Cache-bust was added in `executive.html` to force fresh JS loading.
- `summary.short_text` mapping was added for Brain V2 summary rendering.

### Current Known Critical Domain Bug
Optimization output is still missing **process compatibility filtering**.

Observed issue:
- finishing order `ORD-24115`
- recommended machine `JET-02`
- but `JET-02` belongs to `dyeing`, not `finishing`

Required next fix:
- add order `process_type` ↔ machine `line_id` / process compatibility filter
- exclude incompatible machines from ranking
- optionally mark them as `ineligible` in optimization output
