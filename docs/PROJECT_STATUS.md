# PROJECT STATUS

## Project
Zero@Production

## Current Stable Status
The project is currently stable on the executive dashboard and documentation side.
The working UI must remain untouched in this documentation-only phase.

## Latest Completed Track
Universal Data Intake Agent — Phase 2 / 2.1

### Completed and already committed
- Agent architecture docs
- Canonical intake schema
- Intake workflow
- Review / approval flow
- Report generator architecture draft
- Intake MVP skeleton
- CSV parser
- Pasted text parser
- Normalized JSON writer
- Flat CSV writer
- Review manifest writer
- Hardening layer
- Source hash
- Record fingerprint
- Validation
- Confidence scoring
- TR/EU numeric coercion fix
- CSV string-preserve fix before normalization

## Stable Checkpoints
- Add Data Intake and Report Generator agent architecture docs
- Add Intake Agent MVP skeleton with CSV and text parsers
- Fix intake numeric coercion for TR and EU number formats
- Fix CSV parsing to preserve raw numeric strings before normalization

## What this means
Zero@Production now has a documented and working foundation for a universal intake layer that can accept heterogeneous source data, preserve raw values safely, normalize records into a canonical structure, and prepare a controlled review flow before downstream use.

## Current Scope Lock
This phase updates documentation only.
No UI, dashboard, modal, or runtime behavior should be changed in this phase.

## Next Phase
Report Generator MVP Skeleton

### Target for next phase
- Build report generator agent skeleton
- Define report input contract from reviewed intake data
- Generate Zero@ standard report payloads
- Support structured report outputs for internal and customer-facing use
- Keep review / approval gate before report generation
- Prepare docs and repo structure for later PDF / DOCX / board-report expansion

## Operational Rule
- Terminal-first
- One safe step at a time
- Backup before patch
- No blind overwrite
- Docs-only commit for this phase

## Repo Documentation Status
The following docs are now the primary source of truth for this stage:
- PROJECT_STATUS.md
- PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
- IMPROVEMENTS.md
- AGENTS.md
- DATA_INTAKE_AND_REPORTING_PLAN.md
- AGENTS_ROADMAP_2026-03-11.md
