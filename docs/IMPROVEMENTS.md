# IMPROVEMENTS

## Completed Improvements

### Executive UI stabilization
- recovered working `executive.html`
- removed blank / partial render issue
- protected stable render state

### Card consistency
- CFO mini chart visually aligned with CEO / CTO cards
- CEO mini trend converted to green
- CTO card rendering stabilized

### Header improvements
- green header action styling applied
- Back button cleaned
- Enter Consumption Data button cleaned (“+” removed)

### Decision layer
- Decision Panel filled and interactive
- executive decision area made visually complete

### Operations Layer chart cleanup
- Water chart converted to line
- Energy chart normalized to clean green line
- CO2 chart normalized to blue line
- Wastewater chart normalized to red line

### Deployment improvement
- working branch fast-forward merged into `main`
- GitHub repository now reflects stable executive UI

## Strategic Product Improvements Agreed

### Executive alert model
Decision:
Use **consolidated executive alert logic** instead of multi-row raw alert display.

Reason:
This product is positioned as an Executive Decision System, not a raw operations console.

### New module approved: Universal Data Intake Agent
Purpose:
Convert heterogeneous source data into the canonical manual-form schema.

Capabilities planned:
- source intake from files, images, scans, spreadsheets, text
- extraction and normalization
- schema mapping
- CSV generation
- source archiving
- review/approval workflow

### New module approved: Report Generator Agent
Purpose:
Generate management-ready reports in multiple standards and formats.

Capabilities planned:
- Zero@ standard report generation
- executive board report generation
- ESG / sustainability reporting
- audit report generation
- customizable templates

## Recommended Next Improvements

1. Define canonical intake schema
2. Design intake review flow
3. Design report generator template system
4. Connect normalized data to manual form autofill
5. Add drilldown from Executive Alert to root-cause detail

## 2026-03-11 — Intake Agent Phase 2 / 2.1 Completed

### Done
- Universal Data Intake Agent architecture defined
- MVP skeleton created
- CSV parsing added
- pasted text parsing added
- normalized JSON output added
- flat CSV export added
- review manifest output added
- hardening layer added
- source hash added
- fingerprinting added
- validation added
- confidence scoring added
- TR / EU numeric normalization fix completed
- CSV raw numeric string preservation fix completed

### Why This Matters
This closes the main ingestion reliability gap between raw user input and canonical project data structures.

### Next Improvement Block
- Report Generator MVP skeleton
- first report templates
- report input contract
- report artifact manifest
- approval-ready output flow

## 2026-03-14 — Production Decision Engine Phase

Zero@Production artık sadece veri görüntüleyen bir dashboard değil, aynı zamanda **production decision support layer** olarak çalışmaktadır.

### Implemented Capabilities

Production Decision Engine artık aşağıdaki karar metriklerini üretmektedir:

- recommended machine
- machine capacity
- load percentage
- estimated water usage
- estimated energy consumption
- estimated CO₂ impact
- capacity verdict
- decision note

### Machine Alternatives Layer

Dashboard ayrıca üç makine alternatifi göstermektedir:

- Recommended machine
- Alternative machine A
- Alternative machine B

Her kart aşağıdaki metrikleri içerir:

- machine load %
- energy kWh
- CO₂ kg
- capacity verdict

### Machine Switch Simulation

Kullanıcı alternatif makineye tıkladığında sistem:

- load delta
- energy delta
- water delta
- CO₂ delta

hesaplayarak **impact comparison panel** üretir.

### Sustainability Impact Score

Impact score aşağıdaki ağırlıklarla hesaplanır:

Impact Score =
0.4 * Energy Δ
+0.3 * CO₂ Δ
+0.2 * Water Δ
+0.1 * Load Δ

Severity levels:

- LOW
- MODERATE
- HIGH

### Production What-If Simulator

Dashboard içinde bulunan **machine load slider** ile kullanıcı:

- machine load %
- energy
- water
- CO₂

metriklerini canlı olarak simüle edebilir.

### Next Development Phase

The next step of Zero@Production is to introduce a **Machine Optimizer Layer**.

Planned capabilities:

1. Machine Ranking Engine  
2. Decision Score calculation  
3. Automatic Best Machine suggestion  
4. Multi-scenario comparison  
5. Executive Optimization Panel

The goal is to transform the system from a comparison dashboard into a **Production Optimization Engine**.

## 2026-03-14 — Brain V2 UI / Drawer Improvements

### Added
- Brain V2 first-fetch logic in executive AI drawer
- automatic fallback to Brain V1 endpoint
- Brain V2 normalization layer for frontend rendering
- Executive Views section
- Signals section
- Anomalies section
- Recommended Actions section
- Optimization Decision section
- summary `short_text` mapping support
- cache-bust query string on `executive-ai-insights.js`

### Stability Notes
- avoided large regex rewrite
- applied controlled small patch approach
- preserved existing working modal structure

### Known Remaining Gap
- optimization decision still allows logically incompatible machine proposals
- next improvement must add **process compatibility filter** before machine ranking
